# MonsterPong
https://github.com/michelebucelli/monsterpong entry for [Github GameOff 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018)

### How to play
**Arrow keys** to move your paddle, **spacebar** to shoot.

Play a pong match against a monstrous enemy. If and when you defeat it, steal one of its body parts for yourself. Parts affect your statistics, which in turn affect the game as follows:
* **attack** (atk) - the number of balls you shoot
* **defense** (def) - the strength of the bricks behind your paddle
* **health** (hp) - your points
